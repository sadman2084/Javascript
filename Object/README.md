# JavaScript Object Example

This code demonstrates how to create and access an object in JavaScript.

## Code Breakdown

- **Object Creation**:  
  An object `student` is created with properties:
  - `name`: The student's name (string).
  - `age`: The student's age (number).
  - `gpa`: The student's GPA (number).
  - `lang`: An array of languages spoken by the student.

- **Accessing Object Properties**:  
  The `name` property of the `student` object is accessed and displayed using `document.write(student.name)`.

## Example Output
```
sadman
```

## Key Concepts

- **Object**: A collection of key-value pairs.
- **Accessing Object**: Use dot notation (`student.name`) to access properties of an object.
