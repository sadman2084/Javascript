# JavaScript File Setup Guide

This guide explains how to create and run a simple JavaScript file.

## Steps to Create a JavaScript File

1. **Create a Folder**  
   - Create a folder with any name of your choice.

2. **Create an HTML File**  
   - Inside the folder, create an HTML file (e.g., `index.html`).

3. **Add JavaScript Code**  
   - Open the HTML file and add the following code:
     ```html
     <script>
         alert("hello world"); // This will display a pop-up message.
     </script>
     ```
    <a href="https://github.com/sadman2084/Javascript/blob/main/index.html">Hello world code</a>

4. **Run the File**  
   - Open the HTML file using a live server or directly in a web browser.

That's it! You have successfully created and run a simple JavaScript file.

## Notes
- Make sure to use a text editor like VS Code for easier editing.
- To add more JavaScript code, expand the `<script>` block in your HTML file.
